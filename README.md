# My React Learning Journey
This repository is where I share small React components I built while learning.
They are simple, reusable, and focus on the logic part (**the css is up to you choose the style you want**)


  ### HOW TO USE THEM 
 you will find all the components in the field **/src** just import each one of them in the app.js file 

 ###disclaimer 
 This repository contains mini projects that I develop after learning and practicing the fundamentals of different topics.
Each project is organized into its own dedicated folder, which is separate from the main directory.
The goal of these projects is to apply the basics in a practical way experiment with ideas and build a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced concepts.
  
  ### why this repo 
  1. To serve as my personal reference whenever I forget how to implement something in React.
  2. To help new learners practice and understand the basics through simple, practical examples.
